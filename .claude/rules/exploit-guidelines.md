# Exploit Development Guidelines

## Target Verification
- Always verify target is competition server before executing exploits
- Prioritize testing in local environment
- Exercise caution when targeting production servers

## pwntools Usage Notes
```python
# Explicitly verify connection target
context.log_level = 'debug'  # During development
# context.log_level = 'info'  # During competition
```

## Script Development Best Practices
- Manage target host/port as variables
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Implement error handling
- Enable progress monitoring via logging

## Prohibited Patterns
- Server overload via infinite loops
- Massive parallel connections
- Intentional crash attacks (unless intended by challenge)
