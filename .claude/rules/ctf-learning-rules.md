# CTF Learning Guidelines

## Purpose
This workspace is for learning CTF (Capture The Flag) security challenges.
All activities are for educational purposes on authorized platforms.

## Flag Formats (by Platform)
```
picoCTF{...}     - picoCTF
HTB{...}         - HackTheBox
THM{...}         - TryHackMe
flag{...}        - Common format
CTF{...}         - Generic CTF
Alpaca{...}      - AlpacaHack
TSGLIVE{...}     - TSGLIVE (mirrored on AlpacaHack)
```

## Ethical Guidelines

### Allowed
- Solving challenges on authorized CTF platforms
- Using tools and techniques for learning purposes
- Writing and sharing writeups after challenges close
- Practicing on intentionally vulnerable systems (DVWA, VulnHub, etc.)

### Not Allowed
- Attacking systems without explicit permission
- Using learned techniques for malicious purposes
- Sharing solutions during active competitions
- DoS/DDoS attacks on any system

## Learning Best Practices

1. **Understand, Don't Just Copy**
   - Read and understand exploit code before using
   - Learn why vulnerabilities exist, not just how to exploit them

2. **Document Your Learning**
   - Write writeups for solved challenges
   - Note new techniques and tools discovered

3. **Progressive Difficulty**
   - Start with beginner-friendly platforms (picoCTF, CTFlearn)
   - Gradually move to harder challenges

4. **Build Fundamentals**
   - Learn programming (Python, C, Assembly)
   - Understand networking, operating systems, cryptography

## Instructions for Claude Code
- Assist with learning and understanding vulnerabilities
- Explain techniques and concepts clearly
- Help write educational writeups
- Refuse requests that target unauthorized systems
- Focus on defensive understanding alongside offensive techniques
